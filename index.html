        <h3>2. About me:</h3>
        <p>Seventeen years of experience in marketing and sales. I have developed and introduced brands to the
            market,
            managed business processes, and created teams. My strengths: consistency, a powerful analytical
            background, the
            ability to work with large amounts of information, the ability to multitask without breaking deadlines,
            responsibility and self-discipline.</p>
        <p>I am very interested in front-end development. Front-end for me is an opportunity to create something new
            that
            other people will admire. I am motivated for self-realization in this area and I feel the strength for
            this.</p>

        <h3>5. Experience:</h3>
        <p>I have developed a site on the Joomla platform:
            <a href=" https://extension-pro.com/" target="_blank">www.extension-pro.com</a>
            The site is functional and accessible to users. I also know
            platforms like WIX and Tilda. In my professional career, based on Excel, I developed
            multifactor business models. For example, for the
            <a href="https://extension-pro.com/" target="_blank">Extension Pro</a>
            project, a management accounting system was
            developed: accounting of orders, accounting for stock balances, calculating the demand for orders from
            suppliers, calculating margin, a system of sales reports.
