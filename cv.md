### 2. About me:

Seventeen years of experience in marketing and sales. I have developed and introduced brands to the market, managed business processes, and created teams. My strengths: consistency, a powerful analytical background, the ability to work with large amounts of information, the ability to multitask without breaking deadlines, responsibility and self-discipline.

I am very interested in front-end development. Front-end for me is an opportunity to create something new that other people will admire. I am motivated for self-realization in this area and I feel the strength for this.

### 5. Experience:

I have developed a site on the **Joomla** platform: [www.extension-pro.com](https://extension-pro.com/) The site is functional and accessible to users. I also know platforms like **WIX** and **Tilda**. In my professional career, based on Excel, I developed multifactor business models. For example, for the [Extension Pro](https://extension-pro.com/) project, a management accounting system was developed: accounting of orders, accounting for stock balances, calculating the demand for orders from suppliers, calculating margin, a system of sales reports.
